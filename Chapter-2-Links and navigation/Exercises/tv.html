        <h2>The Plot Twist</h2>
        <p>Starting over isn't easy, especially for John Nolan who, after a life-altering incident,
        is pursuing his dream of joining the LAPD. As their oldest rookie, he's met with skepticism from those who see him as just a walking midlife crisis. The rookies are temporarily 
        paired with new training officers and Officer Nolan is paired with Officer Lopez. 
        When Nolan and Lopez track down an escaped criminal, they discover a little kindness goes a long way. 
        Meanwhile, Jackson is forced to face his fears when he is partnered with Officer Bradford, while Officer Chen and Nolan must face a hard truth.</p>

        <h1>Most Topped Reviews</h1>
        <h2>From "Top_dawg_Critic"</h2>
        <p>At first I thought "no please, not another cop show" and I wasn't sure about Nathan Fillion as a cop. But I must say, the directing is spot on, and the writing is refreshing - especially the relationships of the rookies and their T.O's, 
            their relationship with each other, the conflicts they have to deal with, and the use/views of the body cams. Also surprisingly, 
            Fillion is perfect for this part and nails his role, and all other actors were perfectly cast and also are great in their roles. I especially appreciate seeing the various parts of L.A. 
            and the different people/conflicts the LAPD has to deal with - outside and within the force. So far so good, 
            let's hope the writing progresses as good at the pilot was throughout the season. A well deserved 8/10 from me.</p>

        <h2>From "DiCaprioFan1"</h2>
        <p>The Rookie is one of the better cop shows on tv right now. Nathan Fillion leads a really good cast who all do a good job making this a show worth watching. Anyone who's seen Fillion in a show knows he never disappoints. 
            This show does good job balancing drama, action, suspense and humor. It also shows how tough it is to be a police officer both at work and at home. Some of the 
            negative reviews are from people that don't like that they take real world problems of today and apply them to the show. 
            Everyone knows there are a thousand police shows to choose from but if you're looking for an exciting and original show then give The Rookie a try.</p>
